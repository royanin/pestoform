# Main Codebase of Pestoform.com (no longer maintained actively)
#Remember to change the following before starting this in a new server:

1. Change environment variables in the Flask file
2. Change credentials.py if needed
3. The database url goes in the environment vairables file

## Purpose:

I wanted to build a website which would allow instructors to gather anonymous
feedback from students by sending a simple link.

The resulting website is (hopefully!) still running at [https://pestoform.com].
